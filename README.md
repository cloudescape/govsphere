# Go API for VMware vSphere

Generated by https://github.com/c4milo/gowsdl


## Regeneration
Assuming you have vCenter server or ESX host in 172.16.103.128:

1. `$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/c4milo`
2. `$ gowsdl https://172.16.103.128/sdk/vim.wsdl -i -p govsphere -o govsphere.go`

## Caveats
* In order to use this API you need to understand first [VMware VI object model](http://www.doublecloud.org/2010/02/object-model-of-vmware-vsphere-api-a-big-picture-in-2-minutes/) 
* ManagedObject's properties are missing from the WSDL, so, you have to use the PropertyCollector to retrieve them and use the Managed Object Browser to familiarized yourself with them. ie: https://172.16.103.128/mob


## TODO
* Unwrap request and response types in govsphere.go
* Remove "Type" suffix from request types
* Write scrapper for http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp#com.vmware.wssdk.apiref.doc/index-mo_types.html, the output will be a JSON object that is going to be used to generate ManagedObjects.
* Create ServiceInstance class
* LoginByToken
* Use best API version supported by the server
